# 2D-3D-Shapes-Computing

C++ program that allows the user to create a vector of 2D and 3D geometric
figures then computes their areas and volumes if possible. Elements in your vectors
are made of objects of each class that can be instantiated.

Main Purpose of this Project was to understand the concept of Virtualization/Polymorphism/Inheritance with Classes in C++
